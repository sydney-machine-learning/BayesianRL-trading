# Distributed neuroevolution RL for automatic trading 
This repository is a part of the work done on training Reinforcement Learning Algorithms using G3PCX for automatic trading. Using evolutionary algorithms has played a major role in training of RL problems. 

## Getting Started

The folder with Evo_algo_RL contains the working code. You need to run the file evo_dis_nn.py in the folder evolutionary_Distributed-NN. The code creates a Result folder which will contain the "graph" and the ".csv" files. 

### Prerequisites

The code is based on Python 3.6 and Ubuntu 16. It also uses Pytorch 1.1. You can install Pytorch by running any one of the commands:
```
pip3 install https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu/torch-1.1.0-cp36-cp36m-linux_x86_64.whl
pip3 install https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu/torchvision-0.3.0-cp36-cp36m-linux_x86_64.whl
```
